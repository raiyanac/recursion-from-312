Recursion practice from when I was in EE312, baby's first pure software design/implementation course.  
Found this randomly and put it up for no real reason.  

Requires C++11 because I used nullptr :)  
Lost a lot of the test cases for the functions in here but whatever. They should all work.  
command line:  
g++ -g --std=c++11 random_recursion.cpp
